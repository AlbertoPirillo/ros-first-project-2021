Gear ratio was calibrated by plotting simultaneously in rqt_plot:
-   /scout_odom/twist/twist/linear/x
-   /estimate/twistt/linear/x
And by using the bisection method:
- Interval: [35, 40] => computed value: 37.5 => estimate was bigger
- Interval: [37.5, 40] => computed value: 38.75 => scout_odom was bigger
- Interval: [37.5, 38.75] => computed value: 38.125 => good match between the graphs

The apparent baseline was calibrated in a similar way with:
-   /scout_odom/twist/twist/angular/z
-   /estimate/twist/angular/z
apparent_baseline = real_basiline * x
- With x = 1, estimate was bigger
- With x = 2, scout_odom was bigger
- Interval: [1, 2] => computed value: 1.5 => estimate was bigger
- Interval: [1.5, 2] => computed value: 1.75 => estimate was bigger
- Interval: [1.75, 2] => computed value: 1.875 => scout_odom was bigger
- Interval: [1.75, 1.875] => computed value: 1.8125 => scout_odom was bigger
- Interval: [1.75, 1.8125] => computed value: 1.78125 => good match between the graphs

Later I realized that computing the average of all the bag's values could lead to better results:
Gear calibration:
- /scout_odom/twist/twist/linear/x average: 0.318389
- /estimate/twist/linear/x average: 0.319173
=> ratio: 0.997544

Baseline calibration:
- /scout_odom/twist/twist/angular/z average: 0.073351
- /estimate/twist/angular/z average: 0.072842
=> ratio: 1.006987

So I modified the value I got from bisection with the ratio got obtained by computing the values:
- Gear ratio: 1:38.2189
- Apparent baseline: real baseline * 1.7937 = 1.0457 m
